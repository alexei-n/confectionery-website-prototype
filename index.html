  Shop

  	Orders can only be placed via snail mail. We don’t believe in e-commerce.

  To place an order, simply write down what you would like by hand. Cursive only. Mail it in with a self-addressed, stamped envelope and cash (CAD only) and you should receive your order in 4-6 weeks. 8-12 weeks for international orders. 6-12 months for interplanetary orders. Shipping is flat-rate: $10 within Canada, $100 international, and $10,000 interplanetary.

  		Hard Candy - Like Grandma used to make. $1 each.
  		Chocolate Drops - Just don’t call them “kisses”. $1 each.



  About Us

  	We are a team of one individual, operating at an undisclosed location since 2017. Due to overregulation and harassment from government safety inspectors and taxation agents, our team is forced to work out of a clandestine “Unabomber-style” dwelling deep in the mountains of… We’ve said too much already. All you need to know is that it’s the best candy you’ll ever eat. If it wasn’t, we wouldn’t be able to stay in business!
